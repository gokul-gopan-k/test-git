Grades F and G strictly to be avoidedas default rate is above 30%.\n\n#### 2) Within a grade, low risk subgrade should be preferred.For example, moving from D4 to D1 reduce default rate by 5%.\n\n#### 3) High loan amounts (> 35k)in risky grades should be strictly avoided as they have one of the highest rate of default.For example, high loan amounts t to grade F result in default rate  of more than 30%.\n\n#### 4) High loan amounts (>35k) should preferably not be given to people with multiple public bankruptcies as this combination leads to one of highest default rate. For example, high loan amounts to people of one public bankruptcy gave close to 30% defaultrate while all those with two public bankruptcies defaulted.\n\n#### 5) Among purposes, small business loans should be restricted (>25% default rate) and promote low defaulting purposes like credit card and car(close to 10% default rate)\n\n#### 6) Among purpose, high loan amounts(>35k) should be restricted in small business loans category as default rate is close to 30%.\n \n#### 7) Loans at higher interest rate have higher chance of defaulting. Interest rate till 12% is acceptable but anything above %12 should be restricted as it result in default rate of20%. But this can reduce profits from interest receipts hence as a tradeoff medium interest rate of 8-12% can be suggested which have considerably lower 11% default rate. \n\n#### 8) People with zero derogatory public record should be preferred and those with even one maybe avoided as their default rate is 22%. \n\n#### 9) Borrowers with higher debt to income ratio are more likely to default (about 17%). Hence loans be approved only for people with low debt to income in range less than 10% dti.\n\n#### 10) Loans at shorter term(3 years) should be preferred over longer term. This is because for loans at higher term ,default rate is almost 15% more than those of shorter term. Hence the term of 36 months should be given as default option to reduce loans in 60 months term.\n\n#### 11) Longer term loans (5 years)  should be avoided also for borrowers with lower annual income of less than 40k as they result in default rate of 32%.\n\n#### 12) Lower risk grade have been given low or medium interest rate(<12%) this lead to less than 10% default. Hence this practice should be continued.\n\n#### 13) Purposes like credit card and wedding can be  charged at  medium interest rate(8-12 %) can increase business as default rate is less than 10%.If priority is to reduce default rate over higherinterest payments  then we can charge low interest rate (<8%) as default rate is less than 5% for these categories at low interest rate.\n\n#### 14) Borrowers  with high annual income(>5 lakh) can be  charged at lower interest rate(<8%) as default rate is close to 3% only.\n\n#### 15) To to reduce default rate in high loan amounts (>35k) should be given at low interest rate(<8%) as default rate is low and less than 5%.
